# Integrations
Integrations are what allow you to synchronize data from remote providers (like Fitbit, Todoist, etc.) directly into the platform. This greatly automates things and leaves the burden of having to manually type in all your data.

## Pulling data to Perfice
Pull data to Perfice by setting up an [Integration type](./types) and [Integration entities](./entities).

## Pushing data to Perfice
Pushing data to Perfice is possible by configuring a `push` source in an [Integration entity](./entities).

## Local integrations
Local integrations like Android HealthConnect or Apple Health are currently not yet supported.
